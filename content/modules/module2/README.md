# Module 2: Designing Multi Agent Workflow On Agent Studio

With now a greater appreciation of the complexities in designing Agents by hand, let us now use Agent Studio to build the same workflow. In this Lab we will use Agent Studio to create the same Air quality Investigator System we built earlier.

**Goals**

- [ ] Create Templates and workflows in Agent Studio
- [ ] Learn how to set up agents, tools and tasks
- [ ] Build Custom Tools using Agent Studio
- [ ] Test and Deploy the Workflow
- [ ] Monitor the workflow

## Requirements

- [ ] Access to the Lab Tenant set up with GOES Team
- [ ] Agent Studio is already installed in the assigned Cloudera AI project
