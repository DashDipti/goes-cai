Extract locations, start date, end date, and air quality parameters using the InputParserTool. input_parser_agent A dictionary containing parsed 'locations', 'start_date', 'end_date', and 'aq_parameters' from the user input. For each of the following locations, use the 'bounding_box_extractor' tool to find their bounding box coordinates. Return the bounding boxes associated with each location. bounding_box_retriever A dictionary or list containing the bounding box coordinates (south, west, north, east) for each specified location. For each of the following locations, use the bounding boxes (south, west, north, east), and the start_date and end_date in the context,  to query the weather tool to find a concise summary of relevant historical weather conditions between provided  start_date and end_date. Focus on key weather aspects that might influence air quality (e.g., temperature, wind, precipitation). weather_data_integrator A dictionary or list containing aggregate of historical weather conditions for each specified location. Fetch air quality data using the air_quality_tool for the eacj location: from start_date to end_date ONLY using the bounding boxes for each location. If specific parameters are provided by the aq_parameters attribute, focus on those. Return the data as a pandas DataFrame. air_quality_retriever A pandas DataFrame containing the air quality data for the specified locations, dates, and parameters. Analyze the provided air quality data (including parameters like pm10, value, units, date, and location) for the specified locations and dates. Consider the historical weather information (temperature, wind, precipitation, humidity) for the same period. Identify any trends in air quality, calculate average values where relevant, and discuss any potential correlations or influences of weather conditions on the air quality. Provide a detailed report summarizing the air quality situation for each location, including the key findings and any notable observations related to weather patterns. Include facts and observations to compare the provided locations, as well as your own reliable knowledge base sources to comment on the overall Airquality air_quality_analyst A comprehensive report detailing the air quality analysis for each location, including trends, averages, and a discussion of potential relationships with the historical weather conditions.
